# Diabetes-Patient-s-Hospital-Readmission-Prediction
Hospital readmission is an indicator of the quality of care and is a driver for the increasing cost of healthcare. Like other chronic diseases, Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of hospital readmission. In this project, we evaluate several machine learning approaches to predict the probability of hospital re-admissions for diabetic patients. The data set used for this study contains more than 100,000 diabetic patient data and 50 variables including length of stay, insulin, and in-patient visits from hospitals in the United States. We leverage several pre-processing techniques and investigate the performance of the various models. The signiﬁcant variables contributing to the analysis are the number of in-patients, length of stay, number of medications, number of diagnoses, and age. The results demonstrate the viability of the techniques in providing a better understanding of factors inﬂuencing hospital re-admission.

Different files for preprocessing, modelling and important features have been uploaded in different files.
